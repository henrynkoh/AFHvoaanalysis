Stop spending hours manually monitoring Facebook groups and forums. Get comprehensive AFH insights in 30 seconds with AI.

🧵 Thread: How it works 👇
```

**Tweet 2** (Problem):
```
The Problem:

As an AFH professional, you need to stay on top of:
• Regulatory changes (WAC/RCW updates, bed fees)
• Staffing crises (recruitment, retention, certification)
• Financial pressures (rates, costs, margins)
• Community sentiment (satisfaction, trust)
• Tech barriers (adoption, integration)

But monitoring all channels manually? That's hours every day. 😫
```

**Tweet 3** (Solution Intro):
```
The Solution:

AFH Omni-Pulse uses advanced AI (OpenAI GPT-4o) to automatically:
✅ Scrape content from all your sources
✅ Analyze thousands of posts/comments
✅ Categorize topics intelligently
✅ Identify bottlenecks
✅ Provide actionable solutions

All with ONE CLICK. ⚡

Feature 1: Comprehensive Data Collection

• Facebook groups (WA AFH Providers, etc.)
• Community forums
• Official AFH Council updates
• Social media channels
• Industry newsletters

No more missing important discussions. 📊
```

Feature 2: Smart Categorization

AI automatically organizes content into 5 critical areas:

1️⃣ Regulatory Fatigue (35% avg)
   - Licensing, compliance, bed fees

2️⃣ Staffing Crisis (25% avg)
   - Recruitment, retention, certification

3️⃣ Financial Viability (20% avg)
   - Rates, costs, margins

4️⃣ Community Trust (12% avg)
   - Satisfaction, communication

5️⃣ Tech Barriers (8% avg)
   - Adoption, integration, training
```

**Tweet 6** (Feature 3):
```
Feature 3: Bottleneck Visualization

Interactive radar charts show ecosystem health across 5 dimensions:
• Regulatory (0-100 score)
• Staffing (0-100 score)
• Financial (0-100 score)
• Community (0-100 score)
• Tech (0-100 score)

Higher scores = greater bottlenecks. Visual clarity at a glance. 📈
```

```
Feature 4: Actionable Solutions

Every identified issue comes with:
• Specific solutions
• Who to contact (DSHS, AFH Council, etc.)

Not just problems - SOLUTIONS. 🎯

Question: How do you keep up with what's happening in the AFH ecosystem?
